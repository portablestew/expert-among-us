There are three pairs of files, one about voxels, one about airplanes, and one about flame tanks. They are conversation histories. In each pair, one uses a new MCP,
"expert-among-us". The other does not. Please compare the three case studies. What worked better or worse, with or without the MCP? What insights, files,
etc. were found or missed by each? How did their context usage compare? Would you recommend using the MCP or no? Please create a summary.md document
about this.
